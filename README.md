# Object Counter

This project is regarding to count the number of objects coming through a conveyor belt and display the object count. To display the counter, we decided to use P10 LED Display and used an Arduino nano board as the microcontroller. We use a proximity sensor to detect the objects that coming through the conveyor belt. Then I have designed an HMI to input the current fabric roll count and box count using Easybuilder pro. And added a reset button to reset the current count which display on the LED panel.
